/**
 * The final answer comes from TWO lenses that are weighed against each other:
 *
 *   1. The AI's own judgment (Groq). It is asked to use its full logic and practical wisdom on the
 *      user's situation: what is really being asked, the realistic options, upside / downside /
 *      reversibility, what the emotional state may be distorting, what is still unknown. It scores
 *      the merits of the situation alone (logicScore). The AJIT / MANU / SIVI results are handed
 *      to it as hints.
 *   2. The astrology verdict: the Prashna chart read for this type of question (prashna.service.ts),
 *      mapped to a 0-100 astrologyScore. The AI is told this verdict and must say whether it
 *      supports, is mixed with, or contradicts its own judgment, and reconcile the two.
 *
 * The app then blends them with fixed, visible weights (blendScores: 60% AI judgment, 40% astrology).
 * The AI may nudge the blend by at most MAX_AI_ADJUSTMENT points when it can justify the
 * reconciliation (for example "proceed, but later"), so astrology always counts and a bad completion
 * can never override it. The learning loop (calibration) tempers the result last, and the verdict
 * (YES / CONDITIONAL / NO) is derived from the final number, so verdict and score never disagree.
 * If the AI is unavailable or unusable, the engine answer (modules + astrology) is used.

STEP 1 - YOUR OWN JUDGMENT. Do this first, from the situation itself, with logic, evidence, common sense, psychology and practical wisdom:
- What is really being asked? Which facts are stated and which assumptions are you making?
- What are the realistic options, including waiting, doing nothing, or a middle path?
- For each: likely upside, downside, reversibility, cost of being wrong, and what is within the person's control.
- Is the person's emotional state likely to be distorting the question?
- What missing information would change your answer?
Then give logicScore (0-100): how likely it is that going ahead as the person is asking turns out well, judged on the merits alone. 70+ means YES, 45-69 CONDITIONAL, below 45 NO.
